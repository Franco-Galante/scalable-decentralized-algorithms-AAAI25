The three folders contain code for reproducing the experiments in the paper.
More instructions on how to use the code is provided in each folder.

1. ML_experiment: Fig.3 and Fig.12, implementation of our decentralized FL over
   a dynamic graph (FL-DG) and the benchmarks.
2. multidimensional_means: Fig.4 implementation of the multidimensional disco-
   very phase and evaluation as a function of K (dimensions) over time.
3. scalable_algorithms: Fig.1, 2, 8, 9, 10, and 11, implementation of our
   scalable algorithms B-ColME (message-passing) and C-ColME (consensus).
